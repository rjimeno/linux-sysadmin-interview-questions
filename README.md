#### [[⬆]](#toc) <a name='general'>General Questions:</a>

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
    * 2018-10-18: Simple way to "downgrade" Python 3.7 to 3.6 on my Mac:
    
    `$ brew switch python 3.6.5`


* Talk about your preferred development/administration environment. (OS,
Editor, Browsers, Tools etc.)

    * Development environment: Mac wih OS X & Emacs, closely followed by
        JetBrains IDEs.
    * Universal tool: Firefox or Crome web browsers. I still use Safari and
        Internet Explorer for specific purposes and testing.


* Tell me about the last major Linux project you finished.
    * TODO

    
* Tell me about the biggest mistake you've made in [some recent time period] and
    how you would do it differently today. What did you learn from this experience?
    * TODO

    
* Why we must choose you?
    * Because I'm eager to apply more of my knowledge to help Facebook users to
    stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in the
    world, and to share and express what matters to them.
    (from the vision statement)

    
* What function does DNS play on a network?
    * The DNS translates domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for
    locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying
    network protocols.
    * At its core, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the
    numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services
    and devices with the underlying network protocols.
    * TODO: Elaborate on the advanced features.


* What is HTTP?
    * The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for
        distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the
        foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

        
* What is an HTTP proxy and how does it work?
    * A proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts
        as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from
        other servers. An HTTP proxy is Web proxy and uses the HTTP protocol. HTTP
        proxies can be used for multiple purposes including availability, reliability,
        anonymity, caching and more.

        
* Describe briefly how HTTPS works.
    * HTTPS encapsulates HTTP traffic into an SSL/TLS layer.

    
* What is SMTP? Give the basic scenario of how a mail message is delivered via SMTP.
    * A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) trivial example on how a message is
        delivered follows:
        
        1c. A SMTP client software resolves the name of the SMTP server it needs
            (based on DNS information) and establishes a TCP connection to port
            number 25.
            
        1s. The server shows it accepted the connection with a code 220 answer.
            
        2c. The client sends 'HELO ' followed by the server's domain name.
        
        2s. The server replies with a 250 "pleased to meet you" message, possibly
            describing the features it accepts.
            
        3c. The client sends 'MAIL FROM: ' followed by the email address of the
            sender.
            
        3s. The server normally replies with a 250 MAIL ok message.
        
        4c. The client sends 'RCPT TO: ' followed by the email address of the
            recipient.
            
        4s. The server sends a "250 ok" possibly repeating the recipient's
            email address as indicated above.
            
        5c. The client sends the 'DATA' command.
        
        5s. The server replies with '354' message indicating to proceed.
        
        6c. The client sends one or more lines of text that constitutes the
            email being sent. To indicate the end of the email data, the client
            sends a dot ('.') in a single line by itself.
            
        6s. The server replies with a 250 "message received" or "accepted" or
        "queued" for delivery.
        
        7c. The client sends the 'QUIT' command.
        
        7s. The server responds with a 221 "bye" message.


* What is RAID? What is RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, RAID10?
    * Is an array of (inexpensive or somewhat independent) disks working together
        to benefit from the cooperation. Some examples follow:
        * RAID0 allows for 2 or more disks join as a stripe set and behave as a
            stripe volume. At least two benefits can be obtained from striping:
            - Volumes can be larger than non-RAID volumes and,
            - Volumes can be faster thant non-RAID because data is split evenly
                between all participating disks.
        * RAID1 allows for multiple copies of a disk. Two are the key benefits:
            - Reliability as if disks in the array fail, the array keeps operating
                as long as there is still at least one disks that works.
            - Performance is improved while reading as the data can be fetched
                from all the working copies.
        * RAID10 is also called RAID 1+0 and is a "nested" array that "mirrors"
            RAID1 stripes. A simple example would be mirrored pair of 3-disk stripes.
            The performance could be up to 6-time faster read operations and 3-time
            faster write operations that can tolerate the failure of 1, 2 or 3 disk
            as long as all the failures happen on a single stripe. Note that a for
            RAID10 to keep operating, at least one stripe must remain completely
            intact.
        * RAID5 is a standard (i.e. non-nested) array that keeps multiple copies
            of parity bits that permit the complete recovery of one of the disks
            in the array. RAID5 has low write performance compared to RAID0 &
            RAID1. On the other hand, RAID5 has the most efficient use of space.

            
* What is a level 0 backup? What is an incremental backup?
    * A level 0 backup is a "full backup". It is the first backup in a set of
        either incremental or differential set of backups.

* Describe the general file system hierarchy of a Linux system.
  * /bin/ = Essential User Command Binaries.
  * /boot/ = Static files required to boot the system, for example, the Linux kernel.
    These files are essential for the system to boot properly. 
  * /dev/ = Device nodes that represent devices attached to the system or virtual
    devices provided by the kernel. 
  * /etc/ = configuration files that are local to the machine (i.e. host-specific). It
    should not contain any binariesHost specific system configuration.
  * /home/ = Data that only pertains to a specific user.
  * /media/ = Automatically detected removable media.
  * /mnt/ = Temporarily mounted file systems, such as NFS file system mounts.
  * /opt/ = Software and add-on applications packages that are not part of the
    default installation.
  * /proc/ = Special files that either extract information from the kernel or send
    information to it.
  * /sbin/ = System Binaries.
  * /srv/ = Site-specific data served. This directory gives users the location of data
    files for a particular service, such as FTP, WWW, or CVS. 
  * /tmp/ = Temporary Files.
  * /usr/ = Files that can be shared across multiple machines. Often a partition that
    is mounted read-only. At a minimum, /usr/ should contain the following subdirectories:
    * /usr/bin/ = Usef for binaries.
    * /usr/etc/ = System-wide configuration files.
    * /usr/games/ = Games?
    * /usr/include/ = C header files.
    * /usr/kerberos/ = Kerberos-related binaries and files.
    * /usr/lib/ = Object files and libraries that are not designed to be directly
      utilized by shell scripts or users.
    * /usr/libexec/ = Small helper programs called by other programs.
    * /usr/sbin/ = All system administration binaries, including those essential for
      booting, restoring, recovering, or repairing the system. They require root
      privileges to use.
    * /usr/share/ = Store files that are not architecture-specific.
    * /usr/src/ = Source code.
    * /usr/tmp/ = Is linked to /var/tmp/ and stores temporary files.
    * /usr/local/ = Should be used to store software that should remain safe from
      system software upgrades.
  * /var/ = For variable data. Any program that write log files or need spool or
    lock directories should write them to the /var/ directory


#### [[⬆]](#toc) <a name='simple'>Simple Linux Questions:</a>

* What is the name and the UID of the administrator user?

  root, 0.
  
  
* How to list all files, including hidden ones, in a directory?

  `ls -a`
  
  
* What is the Unix/Linux command to remove a directory and its contents?

  `rmdir`
  
  
* Which command will show you free/used memory? Does free memory exist on Linux?

  `free`
  
  It does but it is called 'available' instead of 'free'. The core point here is
  that Linux will try to take advantage of all the installed memory. The memory
  that is not used by processes will be used for buffering and caches, but will
  immediately be made available if needed by for anything else, like running a
  process, for example.
  
  
* How to search for the string "my konfu is the best" in files of a directory
    recursively?
    
    `grep -r "my konfu is the best" <directory_name>`
    
    
* How to connect to a remote server or what is SSH?

    Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network
    services securely over an unsecured network.
    
    A SSH client process can connect to a SSH server running in a remote machine.
    To open an interactive session the client software would be invoqued as:
    
    `ssh user12@system.example.com`
    
    where 'system.example.com' represents the name of the remote server and
    'user12' represents the name of the user that will be used to for log-in.
    

* How to get all environment variables and how can you use them?

    'set' should display all environment variables but it is probably beeter to
    use 'printenv' or 'env' instead, as only environment variables will be
    displayed.
    
    Environment variables can be used by writing and reading values to and from
    them as follows:
    
    `V=$(date)` # The variable V now holds the date-time at which it was assigned`
    
    The command above shows a way to set the variable V. The following one shows
    a way to read the value in V to display it:
    
    `echo $V # Displays the date and time when V was set using $(date)`


* I get "command not found" when I run ```ifconfig -a```. What can be wrong?

    On recent Linux distributions (like CentOS 7, for example), the net-tools package
    is not required and so, the command `ifconfig` may not be available. That is not
    necessarily wrong because the `ip` command can perform the same functionality.
    
    The specific functionality of `ifconfig -a` is the same (although not completely
    identical) as `ip link show`.

* What happens if I type TAB-TAB?

    The Bash shell will attempt to complete whichever command you are typing by
    "guessing" based on context.
    
    
* What command will show the available disk space on the Unix/Linux system?

    `df`
    

* What commands do you know that can be used to check DNS records?

    `dig` & `nslookup`
    
    
* What Unix/Linux commands will alter a files ownership, files permissions?

    `chown` & `chmod`
    
    
* What does ```chmod +x FILENAME``` do?

    Allows the file named FILENAME to be executed as a command, script or program.
    

* What does the permission 0750 on a file mean?

    The file's owner can read, write and execute the file, while the users that belog
    in the file's group can read and execute (thus, not write) the said file. Other
    users have no permissions at all on this file.
    
    
* What does the permission 0750 on a directory mean?

    That the directory's owner can read (as in `ls`), write (as in create, rename,
    and delete) files and attributes of the directory and enter (as in `cd`) the
    directory. Other users have no permissions whatsoever.
